  {title: "The Cask of Amontillado", text: "THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. AT LENGTH I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled -- but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile NOW was at the thought of his immolation.\r\n\r\nHe had a weak point -- this Fortunato -- although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian MILLIONAIRES. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen , was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially; I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\r\n\r\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\r\n\r\nI said to him -- \"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said he, \"Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible ? And in the middle of the carnival?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amontillado!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my doubts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amontillado!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I must satisfy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amontillado!\"\r\n\r\n\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me\" --\r\n\r\n\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither?\"\r\n\r\n\"To your vaults.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement Luchesi\" --\r\n\r\n\"I have no engagement; come.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted . The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon; and as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\r\n\r\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance , one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\r\n\r\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\r\n\r\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.\r\n\r\n\"The pipe,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication .\r\n\r\n\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length\r\n\r\n\"Nitre,\" I replied. \"How long have you had that cough!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh!\r\n\r\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" I said, with decision, we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi\" --\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.\"\r\n\r\n\"True -- true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily -- but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"\r\n\r\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\r\n\r\n\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\r\n\r\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.\r\n\r\n\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I to your long life.\"\r\n\r\nHe again took my arm and we proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"These vaults,\" he said, are extensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great numerous family.\"\r\n\r\n\"I forget your arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the motto?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nemo me impune lacessit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\r\n\r\n\"The nitre!\" I said: see it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough\" --\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing\" he said; \"let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.\"\r\n\r\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\r\n\r\nI looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement -- a grotesque one.\r\n\r\n\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not of the masons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said \"yes! yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You? Impossible! A mason?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mason,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"A sign,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire.\r\n\r\n\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \"But let us proceed to the Amontillado.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\r\n\r\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead , in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi\" --\r\n\r\n\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered . A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain. from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist . Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.\r\n\r\n\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is VERY damp. Once more let me IMPLORE you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\r\n\r\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was NOT the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided , I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\r\n\r\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated -- I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs , and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I reechoed -- I aided -- I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\r\n\r\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said --\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha! -- he! he! -- a very good joke indeed -- an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo -- he! he! he! -- over our wine -- he! he! he!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"He! he! he! -- he! he! he! -- yes, the Amontillado . But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said \"let us be gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONTRESOR!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\r\n\r\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud --\r\n\r\n\"Fortunato!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. I called again --\r\n\r\n\"Fortunato!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick -- on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I reerected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.\r\n\r\nIn pace requiescat!", author_id: 1, user_id: 1, year: 1846},

  {title: "The Babysitter", text: "She arrives at 7.40, ten minutes late, but the children, Jimmy and\r\nBitsy, are still eating supper, and their parents are not ready to go\r\nyet.  From other rooms come the sounds of a baby screaming, water\r\nrunning, a television musical (no words: probably a dance number\r\n-- patterns of gliding figures come to mind).  Mrs Tucker sweeps into\r\nthe kitchen, fussing with her hair, and snatches a baby bottle full of\r\nmilk out of a pan of warm water, rushes out again.  `Harry!' she calls. \r\n`The babysitter's here already!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  That's My Desire?  I'll Be Around?  He smiles toothily, beckons faintly\r\nwith his head, rubs his fast balding pate.  Bewitched, maybe?  Or,\r\nWhat's the Reason?  He pulls on his shorts, gives his hips a slap.  The\r\nbaby goes silent in mid-scream.  Isn't this the one who used their tub\r\nlast time?  Who's Sorry Now, that's it.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Jack is wandering around town, not knowing what to do.  His girl-\r\nfriend is babysitting at the Tuckers'~, and later, when she's got the\r\nkids in bed, maybe he'll drop over there.  Sometimes he watches TV\r\nwith her when she's babysitting, it's about the only chance he gets to\r\nmake out a little since he doesn't own wheels, but they have to be\r\ncareful because most people don't like their sitters to have boyfriends\r\nover.  Just kissing her makes her nervous.  She won't close her eyes\r\nbecause she has to be watching the door all the time.  Married people\r\nreally have it good, he thinks.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Hi,' the babysitter says to the children, and puts her books on top\r\nof the refrigerator.  `What's for supper?'  The little girl, Bitsy, only\r\nstares at her obliquely.  She joins them at the end of the kitchen table. \r\n`I don't have to go to bed until nine,' the boy announces flatly and\r\nstuffs his mouth full of potato chips.  The babysitter catches a glimpse\r\nof Mr Tucker hurrying out of the bathroom in his underwear.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Her tummy.  Under her arms.  And her feet.  Those are the best places. \r\nShe'll spank him, she says sometimes.  Let her.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  That sweet odour that girls have.  The softness of her blouse.  He\r\ncatches a glimpse of the gentle shadows amid her thighs, as she curls\r\nher legs up under her.  He stares hard at her.  He has a lot of meaning\r\npacked into that stare, but she's not even looking.  She's popping her\r\ngum and watching television.  She's sitting right there, inches away,\r\nsoft, fragrant, and ready: but what's his next move?  He notices his\r\nbuddy Mark in the drugstore, playing the pinball machine, and joins\r\nhim.  `Hey, this mama's cold, Jack baby!  She needs your touch!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Mrs Tucker appears at the kitchen doorway, holding a rolled-up\r\ndiaper.  `Now, don't just eat potato chips, Jimmy!  See that he eats\r\nhis hamburger, dear.'  She hurries away to the bathroom.  The boy\r\nglares sullenly at the babysitter, silently daring her to carry out the\r\norder.  `How about a little of that good hamburger now, Jimmy?'\r\nshe says perfunctorily.  He lets half of it drop to the floor.  The baby\r\nis silent and a man is singing a love song on the TV.  The children\r\ncrunch chips.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n  He loves her.  She loves him.  They whirl airily, stirring a light breeze,\r\nthrough a magical landscape of rose and emerald and deep blue.  Her\r\nlight brown hair coils and wisps softly in the breeze, and the soft\r\nfolds of her white gown tug at her body and then float away.  He\r\nsmiles in a pulsing crescendo of sincerity and song.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `You mean she's alone?' Mark asks.  `Well, there's two or three kids,'\r\nJack says.  He slides the coin in.  There's a rumble of steel balls\r\ntumbling, lining up.  He pushes a plunger with his thumb, and one\r\nball pops up in place, hard and glittering with promise.  His stare? to\r\nsay he loves her.  That he cares for her and would protect her, would\r\nshield her, if need be, with his own body.  Grinning he bends over the\r\nball to take careful aim: he and Mark have studied this machine and\r\nhave it figured out, but still it's not that easy to beat.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  On the drive to the party, his mind is partly on the girl, partly on his\r\nown high-school days, long past.  Sitting at the end of the kitchen\r\ntable there with his children, she had seemed to be self-consciously\r\narching her back, jutting her pert breasts, twitching her thighs: and\r\nfor whom if not for him?  So she'd seen him coming out of there,\r\nafter all.  He smiles.  Yet what could he ever do about it?  Those good\r\ntimes are gone, old man.  He glances over at his wife, who, readjust-\r\ning a garter, asks: `What do you think of our babysitter?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  He loves her.  She loves him.  And then the babies come.  And dirty\r\nnappies and one goddamn meal after another.  Dishes.  Noise.  Clutter. \r\nAnd fat.  Not just tight, her girdle actually hurts.  Somewhere recently\r\nshe's read about women getting heart attacks or cancer or something\r\nfrom too-tight girdles.  Dolly pulls the car door shut with a grunt,\r\nstrangely irritated, not knowing why.  Party mood.  Why is her hus-\r\nband humming _Who's Sorry Now?_  Pulling out of the drive, she\r\nglances back at the lighted kitchen window.  `What do you think\r\nof our babysitter?' she asks.  While her husband stumbles all over\r\nhimself trying to answer, she pulls a stocking tight, biting deeper\r\nwith the garters.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Stop it!' she laughs.  Bitsy is pulling on her skirt and he is tickling\r\nher in the ribs.  `Jimmy!  Don't!'  But she is laughing too much to stop\r\nhim.  He leaps on her, wrapping his legs around her waist, and they\r\nall fall to the carpet in front of the TV, where just now a man in a\r\ntuxedo and a little girl in a flouncy white dress are doing a tapdance\r\ntogether.  The babysitter's blouse is pulling out of her skirt, showing\r\na patch of bare tummy: the target.  `I'll spank!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Jack pushes the plunger, thrusting up a steel ball, and bends studi-\r\nously over the machine.  `You getting any off her?'  Mark asks, and\r\nclears his throat, flicks ash from his cigarette.  `Well, not exactly, not\r\nyet,' Jack says, grinning awkwardly, but trying to suggest more than\r\nhe admits to, and fires.  He heaves his weight gently against the\r\nmachine as the ball bounds off a rubber bumper.  He can feel her\r\nwarming up under his hands, the flippers suddenly coming alive, deli-\r\ncate rapid-fire patterns emerging in the flashing of the lights.  =1000\r\nwhen lit!= _now!_  `Got my hand on it, that's about all.'  Mark glances\r\nup from the machine, cigarette dangling from his lip.  `Maybe you\r\nneed some help,' he suggests with a wry one-sided grin.  `Like maybe\r\ntogether, man, we could do it.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She likes the big tub.  She uses the Tuckers'~ bath salts, and loves to\r\nsink into the hot fragrant suds.  She can stretch out, submerged, up\r\nto her chin.  It gives her a good sleepy tingly feeling.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `What do you think of our babysitter?'  Dolly asks, adjusting a\r\ngarter.  `Oh, I hardly noticed,' he says.  `Cute girl.  She seems to get\r\nalong fine with the kids.  Why?'  `I don't know.'  His wife tugs her\r\nskirt down, glances at a lighted window they are passing, adding:\r\n`I'm not sure I trust her completely, that's all.  With the baby, I mean. \r\nShe seems a little careless.  And the other time, I'm almost sure she\r\nhad a boyfriend over.'  He grins, claps one hand on his wife's broad\r\ngartered thigh.  `What's wrong with that?' he asks.  Still in anklets,\r\ntoo.  Bare thighs, no girdles, nothing up there but a flimsy pair of\r\npanties and soft adolescent flesh.  He's flooded with vague remem-\r\nbrances of football matches and movie balconies.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  How tiny and rubbery it is!  She thinks, soaping between the boy's\r\nlegs, giving him his bath.  Just a funny jiggly little thing that looks\r\nlike it shouldn't even be there at all.  Is that what all the songs are\r\nabout?\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Jack watches Mark lunge and twist against the machine.  Got her\r\nrunning now, racking them up.  He's not too excited about the idea of\r\nMark fooling around with his girlfriend, but Mark's a cooler operator\r\nthan he is, and maybe, doing it together this once, he'd get over his\r\nown timidity.  And if she didn't like it, there were other girls around. \r\nIf Mark went too far, he could cut him off, too.  He feels his shoulders\r\ntense: enough's enough, man... but sees the flesh, too.  `Maybe I'll\r\ncall her later,' he says.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Hey, Harry!  Dolly!  Glad you could make it!'  `I hope we're not late.' \r\n`No, no, you're one of the first, come on in!  By golly, Dolly, you're\r\nlooking younger every day!  How do you do it?  Give my wife your\r\nsecret, will you?'  He pats her on her girdled bottom behind Mr\r\nTucker's back, leads them in for drinks.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  8.00.  The babysitter runs water in the tub, combs her hair in front of\r\nthe bathroom mirror.  There's a western on television, so she lets\r\nJimmy watch it while she gives Bitsy her bath.  But Bitsy doesn't\r\nwant a bath.  She's angry and crying because she has to be first.  The\r\nbabysitter tells her if she'll take her bath quickly, she'll let her watch\r\ntelevision while Jimmy takes his bath, but it does no good.  The little\r\ngirl fights to get out of the bathroom, and the babysitter has to squat\r\nwith her back against the door and forcibly undress the child.  There\r\nare better places to babysit.  Both children mind badly, and then,\r\nsooner or later, the baby is sure to wake up for a nappy change and\r\nmore bottle.  The Tuckers do have a good colour TV, though, and she\r\nhopes things will be settled down enough to catch the 8.30 pro-\r\ngramme.  She thrusts the child into the tub, but she's still screaming\r\nand thrashing around.  `Stop it now, Bitsy, or you'll wake the baby!' \r\n`I have to go potty' the child wails, switching tactics.  The babysitter\r\nsighs, lifts the girl out of the tub and onto the toilet, getting her skirt\r\nand blouse all wet in the process.  She glances at herself in the mirror. \r\nBefore she knows it, the girl is off the seat and out of the bathroom. \r\n`Bitsy!  Come back here!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Okay, that's enough!'  Her skirt is ripped and she's flushed and cry-\r\ning.  `Who says?'  `I do, man!'  The bastard goes for her, but he tackles\r\nhim.  They roll and tumble.  Tables tip, lights topple, the TV crashes to\r\nthe floor.  He slams a hard right to the guy's gut, clips his chin with\r\na rolling left.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `We hope it's a girl.'  That's hardly surprising, since they already\r\nhave four boys.  Dolly congratulates the woman like everybody else,\r\nbut she doesn't envy her, not a bit.  That's all she needs about now. \r\nShe stares across the room at Harry, who is slapping backs and\r\ngetting loud, as usual.  He's spreading out through the middle, so why\r\nthe hell does he have to complain about her all the time?  `Dolly,\r\nyou're looking younger every day!' was the nice greeting she got\r\ntonight.  `What's your secret?'  And Harry: `It's all those calories. \r\nShe's getting back her baby fat.'  `Haw, haw!  Harry, have a heart!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Get her feet!' he hollers at Bitsy, his fingers in her ribs, running\r\nover her naked tummy, tangling in the underbrush of straps and\r\nstrange clothing.  `Get her shoes off!'  He holds her pinned by press-\r\ning his head against her soft chest.  `No!  No, Jimmy!  Bitsy, stop!' \r\nBut though she kicks and twists and rolls around, she doesn't get up,\r\nshe can't get up, she's laughing too hard, and the shoes come off,\r\nand he grabs a stocking foot and scratches the sole ruthlessly, and\r\nshe raises up her legs, trying to pitch him off, she's wild, boy, but he\r\nhangs on, and she's laughing, and on the screen there's a rattle of\r\nhooves, and he and Bitsy are rolling around and around on the floor\r\nin a crazy rodeo of long bucking legs.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  He slips the coin in.  There's a metallic fall and a sharp click as the\r\ndial tone begins.  `I hope the Tuckers have gone,' he says.  `Don't\r\nworry, they're at our place,' Mark says.  `They're always the first ones\r\nto come and the last ones to go home.  My old man's always bitching\r\nabout them.'  Jack laughs nervously and dials the number.  `Tell her\r\nwe're coming over to protect her from getting raped,' Mark suggests,\r\nand lights a cigarette.  Jack grins, leaning casually against the door\r\njamb of the phone booth, chewing gum, one hand in his pocket.  He's\r\nreally pretty uneasy, though.  He has the feeling he's somehow\r\nmessing up a good thing.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Bitsy runs naked into the living-room, keeping a hassock between\r\nherself and the babysitter.  `Bitsy...!' the babysitter threatens.  Arti-\r\nficial reds and greens and purples flicker over the child's wet body,\r\nas hooves clatter, guns crackle, and stagecoach wheels thunder over\r\nrutted terrain.  `Get outa the way, Bitsy!' the boy complains.  `I can't\r\nsee!'  Bitsy streaks past and the babysitter chases, cornering the girl\r\nin the back bedroom.  Bitsy throws something that hits her softly in\r\nthe face: a pair of men's undershorts.  She grabs the girl scampering\r\nby, carries her to the bathroom, and with a smart crack on her glis-\r\ntening bottom pops her back into the tub.  In spite, Bitsy peepees in\r\nthe bathwater.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Mr Tucker stirs a little water into his bourbon and kids with his\r\nhost and another man, just arrived, about their golf games.  They set\r\nup a match for the weekend, a threesome looking for a fourth.  Hold-\r\ning his drink in his right hand, Mr Tucker swings his left through\r\nthe motion of a tee-shot.  `You'll have to give me a stroke a hole,' he\r\nsays.  `I'll give you a stroke!' says his host.  `Bend over!'  Laughing,\r\nthe other man asks: `Where's your boy Mark tonight?'  `I don't know,'\r\nreplies the host, gathering up a trayful of drinks.  Then he adds in a\r\nlow growl: `Out chasing tail probably.'  They chuckle loosely at that,\r\nthen shrug in commiseration and return to the livingroom to join\r\ntheir women.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Shades pulled.  Door locked.  Watching the TV.  Under a blanket\r\nmaybe.  Yes, that's right, under a blanket.  Her eyes close when he\r\nkisses her.  Her breasts, under both their hands, are soft and yielding.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  A hard blow to the belly.  The face.  The dark beardy one staggers. \r\nThe lean-jawed sheriff moves in, but gets a spurred boot in his face. \r\nThe dark one hurls himself forward, drives his shoulder into the\r\nsheriff's hard midriff, her own tummy tightens, withstands, as the\r\nsheriff smashes the dark man's nose, slams him up against a wall,\r\nslugs him again! and again!  The dark man grunts rhythmically,\r\nbacks off, then plunges suicidally forward -- her own knees draw up\r\nprotectively -- the sheriff staggers! caught low! but instead of follow-\r\ning through the other man steps back -- a pistol! the dark one has a\r\npistol! the sheriffs draws! shoots from the hip! explosions! she\r\nclutches her hands between her thighs -- no! the sheriff spins!\r\nwounded! the dark man hesitates, aims, her legs stiffen towards the\r\nset, the sheriff rolls desperately in the straw, fires: dead! the dark\r\nman is dead! groans, crumples, his pistol drooping in his collapsing\r\nhand, dropping, he drops.  The sheriff, spent, nicked, watches weakly\r\nfrom the floor where he lies.  Oh, to be whole! to be good and strong\r\nand right! to embrace and be embraced by harmony and wholeness! \r\nThe sheriff, drawing himself painfully up on one elbow, rubs his\r\nbruised mouth with the back of his other hand.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Well, we just sorta thought we'd drop over,' he says, and winks\r\nbroadly at Mark.  `Who's we?'  `Oh, me and Mark here.'  `Tell her, good\r\nthing like her, gotta pass it around,' whispers Mark, dragging on his\r\nsmoke, then flicking the butt over under the pinball machine.  `What's\r\nthat?' she asks.  `Oh, Mark and I were just saying, like two's company,\r\nthree's an orgy,' Jack says, and winks again.  She giggles.  `Oh, Jack!' \r\nBehind her, he can hear shouts and gunfire.  `Well, okay, for just a\r\nlittle while, if you'll both be good.'  Way to go, man.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Probably some damn kid over there right now.  Wrestling around on\r\nthe couch in front of his TV.  Maybe he should drop back to the\r\nhouse.  Just to check.  None of that stuff, she was there to do a job! \r\nPark the car a couple doors down, slip in the front door before she\r\nknows it.  He sees the disarray of clothing, the young thighs exposed\r\nto the flickering television light, hears his baby crying.  `Hey, what's\r\ngoing on here!  Get outa here, son, before I call the police!'  Of course,\r\nthey haven't really been doing anything.  They probably don't even\r\nknow how.  He stares benignly down upon the girl, her skirt rumpled\r\nloosely around her thighs.  Flushed, frightened, yet excited, she stares\r\nback at him.  He smiles.  His finger touches a knee, approaches the\r\nhem.  Another couple arrives.  Filling up here with people.  He wouldn't\r\nbe missed.  Just slip out, stop back casually to pick up something or\r\nother he forgot, never mind what.  He remembers that the other\r\ntime they had this babysitter, she took a bath in their house.  She had\r\na date afterwards, and she'd just come from cheerleading practice or\r\nsomething.  Aspirin maybe.  Just drop quietly and casually into the\r\nbathroom to pick up some aspirin.  `Oh, excuse me, dear!  I only...!' \r\nShe gazes back at him, astonished, yet strangely moved.  Her soft wet\r\nbreasts rise and fall in the water, and her tummy looks pale and\r\nripply.  He recalls that her pubic hairs, left in the tub, were brown. \r\nLight brown.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She's no more than stepped into the tub for a quick bath, when\r\nJimmy announces from outside the door that he has to go to the\r\nbathroom.  She sighs: just an excuse, she knows.  `You'll have to\r\nwait.'  The little nuisance.  `I can't wait.'  `Okay, then come ahead, but\r\nI'm taking a bath.'  She supposes that will stop him, but it doesn't. \r\nIn he comes.  She slides down into the suds until she's eye-level with\r\nthe edge of the tub.  He hesitates.  `Go ahead, if you have to,' she says,\r\na little awkwardly, `but I'm not getting out.'  `Don't look,' he says. \r\nShe: `I will if I want to.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She's crying.  Mark is rubbing his jaw where he's just slugged him. \r\nA lamp lies shattered.  `Enough's enough, Mark!  Now get outa here!' \r\nHer skirt is ripped to the waist, her bare hip bruised.  Her panties lie\r\non the floor like a broken balloon.  Later, he'll wash her wounds, help\r\nher dress, he'll take care of her.  Pity washes through him, giving him\r\na sudden hard-on.  Mark laughs at it, pointing.  Jack crouches, waiting,\r\nready for anything.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Laughing, they roll and tumble.  Their little hands are all over her,\r\ndigging and pinching.  She struggles to her hands and knees, but Bitsy\r\nleaps astride her neck, bowing her head to the carpet.  `Spank her,\r\nJimmy!'  His swats sting: is her skirt up?  The phone rings.  `The\r\ncavalry to the rescue!' she laughs, and throws them off to go answer.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Kissing Mark, her eyes closed, her hips nudge towards Jack.  He\r\nstares at the TV screen, unsure of himself, one hand slipping cau-\r\ntiously under her skirt.  Her hand touches his arm as though to resist,\r\nthen brushes on by to rub his leg.  This blanket they're under was a\r\ngood idea.  `Hi!  This is Jack!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Bitsy's out and the water's running.  `Come on, Jimmy, your turn!' \r\nLast time, he told her he took his own baths, but she came in any-\r\nway.  `I'm not gonna take a bath,' he announces, eyes glued on the\r\nset.  He readies for the struggle.  `But I've already run your water. \r\nCome on, Jimmy, please!'  He shakes his head.  She can't make him,\r\nhe's sure he's as strong as she is.  She sighs.  `Well, it's up to you.  I'll\r\nuse the water myself then,' she says.  He waits until he's pretty sure\r\nshe's not going to change her mind, then sneaks in and peeks through\r\nthe keyhole in the bathroom door: just in time to see her big bottom\r\nas she bends over to stir in the bubblebath.  Then she disappears. \r\nTrying to see as far down as the keyhole will allow, he bumps his\r\nhead on the knob.  `Jimmy, is that you?'  `I -- I have to go to the\r\nbathroom!' he stammers.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Not actually in the tub, just getting in.  One foot on the mat, the\r\nother in the water.  Bent over slightly, buttocks flexed, teats swaying,\r\nholding on to the edge of the tub.  `Oh, excuse me!  I only wanted...!' \r\nHe passes over her astonishment, the awkward excuses, moves\r\nquickly to the part where he reaches out to --  `What on earth are\r\nyou doing, Harry?' his wife asks, staring at his hand.  His host, pass-\r\ning, laughs.  `He's practising his swing for Sunday, Dolly, but it's not\r\ngoing to do him a damn bit of good!'  Mr Tucker laughs, sweeps his\r\nright hand on through the air as though lifting a seven-iron shot onto\r\nthe green.  He makes a _dok!_ sound with his tongue.  `In there!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `No, Jack, I don't think you'd better.'  `Well, we just called, we just,\r\nuh, thought we'd, you know, stop by for a minute, watch television\r\nfor thirty minutes, or, or something.'  `Who's we?'  `Well, Mark's here,\r\nI'm with him, and he said he'd like to, you know, like if it's all right,\r\njust --'  `Well, it's _not_ all right.  The Tuckers said no.'  `Yeah, but if we\r\nonly --'  `And they seemed awfully suspicious about last time.'  `Why? \r\nWe didn't -- I mean, I just thought --'  `No, Jack, and that's period.' \r\nShe hangs up.  She returns to the TV, but the commercial is on.  Any-\r\nway, she's missed most of the show.  She decides maybe she'll take a\r\nquick bath.  Jack might come by anyway, it'd make her mad, that'd\r\nbe the end as far as he was concerned, but if he should, she doesn't\r\nwant to be all sweaty.  And besides, she likes the big tub the Tuckers\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  He is self-conscious and stands with his back to her, his little neck\r\nflushed.  It takes him forever to get started, and when it finally does\r\ncome, it's just a tiny trickle.  `See, it was just an excuse,' she scolds,\r\nbut she's giggling inwardly at the boy's embarrassment.  `You're just\r\na nuisance, Jimmy.'  At the door, his hand on the knob, he hesitates,\r\nstaring timidly down on his shoes.  `Jimmy?'  She peeks at him over\r\nthe edge of the tub, trying to keep a straight face, as he sneaks a\r\nnervous glance back over his shoulder.  `As long as you bothered me,'\r\nshe says, `you might as well soap my back.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `The aspirin...'  They embrace.  She huddles in his arms like a child. \r\nLovingly, paternally, knowledgeably, he wraps her nakedness.  How\r\ncompact, how tight and small her body is!  Kissing her ear, he stares\r\ndown past her rump at the still clear water.  `I'll join you,' he whispers\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She picks up the shorts Bitsy threw at her.  Men's underwear.  She\r\nholds them in front of her, looks at herself in the bedroom mirror. \r\nAbout twenty sizes too big for her, of course.  She runs her hand\r\ninside the opening in front, pulls out her thumb.  How funny it must\r\nfeel!\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Well, man, I say we just go rape her,' Mark says flatly, and swings\r\nhis weight against the pinball machine.  `Uff!  Ahh!  Get in there, you\r\nmother!  Look at that!  Hah!  Man, I'm gonna turn this baby over!' \r\nJack is embarrassed about the phone conversation.  Mark just snorted\r\nin disgust when he hung up.  He cracks down hard on his gum, angry\r\nthat he's such a chicken.  `Well, I'm game if you are,' he says coldly.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  8.30.  `Okay, come on, Jimmy, it's time.'  He ignores her.  The western\r\ngives way to a spy show.  Bitsy, in pyjamas, pads into the livingroom. \r\n`No, Bitsy, it's time to go to bed.'  `You said I could watch!' the girl\r\nwhines, and starts to throw another tantrum.  `But you were too\r\nslow and it's late.  Jimmy, you get in that bathroom, and right now!' \r\nJimmy stares sullenly at the set, unmoving.  The babysitter tries to\r\ncatch the opening scene of the television programme so she can\r\nfollow it later, since Jimmy gives himself his own baths.  When the\r\ncommercial interrupts, she turns off the sound, stands in front of\r\nthe screen.  `Okay, into the tub, Jimmy Tucker, or I'll take you in there\r\nand give you your bath myself!'  `Just try it,' he says, `and see what\r\nhappens.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  They stand outside, in the dark, crouched in the bushes, peeking in. \r\nShe's on the floor, playing with the kids.  Too early.  They seem to be\r\ntickling her.  She gets to her hands and knees, but the little girl leaps\r\non her head, pressing her face to the floor.  There's an obvious target,\r\nand the little boy proceeds to beat on it.  `Hey, look at that kid go!'\r\nwhispers Mark, laughing and snapping his fingers softly.  Jack feels\r\nuneasy out here.  Too many neighbours, too many cars going by, too\r\nmany people in the world.  That little boy in there is one up on him,\r\nthough: he's never thought about tickling her as a starter.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  His little hand, clutching the bar of soap, lathers shyly a narrow\r\nspace between her shoulderblades.  She is doubled forward against\r\nher knees, buried in rich suds, peeking at him over the edge of her\r\nshoulder.  The soap slithers out of his grip and plunks into the water. \r\n`I... I dropped the soap,' he whispers.  She: `Find it.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `I dream of Jeannie with the light brown pubic hair!'  `Harry!  Stop\r\nthat!  You're drunk!'  But they're laughing, they're all laughing, damn!\r\nhe's feeling pretty goddamn good at that, and now he just knows he\r\nneeds that aspirin.  Watching her there, her thighs spread for him, on\r\nthe couch, in the tub, hell, on the kitchen table for that matter, he\r\ntees off on Number Nine, and -- _whap_ -- swats his host's wife on the\r\nbottom.  `Hole in one!' he shouts.  `Harry!'  Why can't his goddamn\r\nwife Dolly ever get happy-drunk instead of sour-drunk all the time? \r\n`Gonna be tough Sunday, old buddy!'  `You're pretty tough right now,\r\nHarry,' says his host.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  The babysitter lunges forward, grabs the boy by the arms and hauls\r\nhim off the couch, pulling two cushions with him, and drags him\r\ntowards the bathroom.  He lashes out, knocking over an endtable full\r\nof magazines and ashtrays.  `You leave my brother alone!' Bitsy cries\r\nand grabs the sitter around the waist.  Jimmy jumps on her and down\r\nthey all go.  On the silent screen, there's a fade-in to a dark passage-\r\nway in an old apartment building in some foreign country.  She kicks\r\nout and somebody falls between her legs.  Somebody else is sitting on\r\nher face.  `Jimmy!  Stop that!' the babysitter laughs, her voice\r\nmuffled.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She's watching television.  All alone.  It seems like a good time to go\r\nin.  Just remember: really, no matter what she says, she wants it. \r\nThey're standing in the bushes, trying to get up the nerve.  `We'll\r\ntell her to be good,' Mark whispers, `and if she's not good, we'll\r\nspank her.'  Jack giggles softly, but his knees are weak.  She stands. \r\nThey freeze.  She looks right at them.  `She can't see us,' Mark whis-\r\npers tensely.  `Is she coming out?'  `No,' says Mark, `she's going into\r\n-- that must be the bathroom!'  Jack takes a deep breath, his heart\r\npounding.  `Hey, is there a window back there?'  Mark asks.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  The phone rings.  She leaves the tub, wrapped in a towel.  Bitsy gives\r\na tug on the towel.  `Hey, Jimmy, get the towel!' she squeals.  `Now\r\nstop that, Bitsy!' the babysitter hisses, but too late: with one hand\r\non the phone, the other isn't big enough to hang on to the towel.  Her\r\nsudden nakedness awes them and it takes them a moment to remem-\r\nber about tickling her.  By then, she's in the towel again.  `I hope you\r\ngot a good look,' she says angrily.  She feels chilled and oddly a little\r\nfrightened.  `Hello?'  No answer.  She glances at the window -- is some-\r\nbody out there?  Something, she saw something, and a rustling --\r\nfootsteps?\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Okay, I don't care, Jimmy, don't take a bath,' she says irritably.  Her\r\nblouse is pulled out and wrinkled, her hair is all mussed, and she\r\nfeels sweaty.  There's about a million things she'd rather be doing\r\nthan babysitting with these two.  Three: at least the baby's sleeping. \r\nShe knocks on the overturned endtable for luck, rights it, replaces\r\nthe magazines and ashtrays.  The one thing that really makes her\r\nsick is a dirty nappy.  `Just go on to bed.'  `I don't have to go to bed\r\nuntil nine,' he reminds her.  Really, she couldn't care less.  She turns\r\nup the volume on the TV, settles down on the couch, poking her\r\nblouse back into her skirt, pushing her hair out of her eyes.  Jimmy\r\nand Bitsy watch from the floor.  Maybe, once they're in bed, she'll\r\ntake a quick bath.  She wishes Jack would come by.  The man, no\r\ndoubt the spy, is following a woman, but she doesn't know why.  The\r\nwoman passes another man.  Something seems to happen, but it's\r\nnot clear what.  She's probably already missed too much.  The phone\r\nrings.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Mark is kissing her.  Jack is under the blanket, easing her panties\r\ndown over her squirming hips.  Her hand is in his pants, pulling it out,\r\npulling it towards her, pulling it hard.  She knew just where it was! \r\nMark is stripping, too.  God, it's really happening! he thinks with a\r\nkind of pious joy, and notices the open door.  `Hey!  What's going on\r\nhere?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  He soaps her back, smooth and slippery under his hand.  She is\r\ndoubled over, against her knees, between his legs.  Her light brown\r\nhair, reaching to her gleaming shoulders, is wet at the edges.  The\r\nsoap slips, falls between his legs.  He fishes for it, finds it, slips it\r\nbehind him.  `Help me find it,' he whispers in her ear.  `Sure Harry,'\r\nsays his host, going round behind him.  `What'd you lose?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Soon be nine, time to pack the kids off to bed.  She clears the table,\r\ndumps paper plates and leftover hamburgers into the garbage, puts\r\nglasses and silverware into the sink, and the mayonnaise, mustard,\r\nand ketchup in the refrigerator.  Neither child has eaten much supper\r\nfinally, mostly potato chips and ice-cream, but it's really not her\r\nproblem.  She glances at the books on the refrigerator.  Not much\r\nchance she'll get to them, she's already pretty worn out.  Maybe she'd\r\nfeel better if she had a quick bath.  She runs water into the tub, tosses\r\nin bubblebath salts, undresses.  Before pushing down her panties, she\r\nstares for a moment at the smooth silken panel across her tummy,\r\nfingers the place where the opening would be if there were one.  Then\r\nshe steps quickly out of them, feeling somehow ashamed, unhooks\r\nher brassiere.  She weighs her breasts in the palms of her hands,\r\nwatching herself in the bathroom mirror, where in the open window\r\nbehind her, she sees a face.  She screams.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She screams: `Jimmy!  Give me that!'  `What's the matter?' asks Jack\r\non the other end.  `Jimmy!  Give me my towel!  Right now!'  `Hello? \r\nHey, are you still there?'  `I'm sorry, Jack,' she says, panting.  `You\r\ncaught me in the tub.  I'm just wrapped in a towel and these silly kids\r\ngrabbed it away!'  `Gee, I wish I'd been there!'  `Jack --!'  `To protect\r\nyou, I mean.'  `Oh, sure,' she says, giggling.  `Well, what do you think,\r\ncan I come over and watch TV with you?'  `Well, not right this\r\nminute,' she says.  He laughs lightly.  He feels very cool.  `Jack?' \r\n`Yeah?'  `Jack, I... I think there's somebody outside the window!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She carries him, fighting all the way, to the tub, Bitsy pummelling\r\nher in the back and kicking her ankles.  She can't hang on to him\r\nand undress him at the same time.  `I'll throw you in, clothes and all,\r\nJimmy Tucker!' she gasps.  `You better not!' he cries.  She sits on the\r\ntoilet seat, locks her legs around him, whips his shirt up over his\r\nhead before he knows what's happening.  The pants are easier.  Like\r\nall little boys his age, he has almost no hips at all.  He hangs on\r\ndesperately to his underpants, but when she succeeds in snapping\r\nthese down out of his grip, too, he gives up, starts to bawl, and beats\r\nher wildly in the face with his fists.  She ducks her head, laughing\r\nhysterically, oddly entranced by the spectacle of that pale little thing\r\ndown there, bobbing and bouncing rubberily about with the boy's\r\nhelpless fury and anguish.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Aspirin?  Whaddaya want aspirin for, Harry?  I'm sure they got\r\naspirin here, if you --'  `Did I say aspirin?  I meant, uh, my glasses. \r\nAnd, you know, I thought, well, I'd sorta check to see if everything\r\nwas okay at home.'  Why the hell is it his mouth feels like it's got\r\nabout six sets of teeth packed in there, and a tongue the size of that\r\nliverwurst his host's wife is passing around?  `Whaddaya want your\r\nglasses for, Harry?  I don't understand you at all!'  `Aw, well, honey,\r\nI was feeling kind of dizzy or something, and I thought --'  `Dizzy is\r\nright.  If you want to check on the kids, why don't you just call on the\r\nphone?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  They can tell she's naked and about to get into the tub, but the\r\nbathroom window is frosted glass, and they can't see anything\r\nclearly.  `I got an idea,' Mark whispers.  `One of us goes and calls her\r\non the phone, and the other watches when she comes out.'  `Okay,\r\nbut who calls?'  `Both of us, we'll do it twice.  Or more.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Down forbidden alleys.  Into secret passageways.  Unlocking the world's\r\nterrible secrets.  Sudden shocks: a trapdoor! a fall! or the stunning\r\nreport of a rifle shot, the _whaaii-ii-iing!_ of the bullet biting concrete\r\nby your ear!  Careful!  Then edge forward once more, avoiding the\r\nlight, inch at a time, now a quick dash for an open doorway -- _look\r\nout!_ there's a knife! a struggle! no! the long blade glistens! jerks!\r\nthrusts! _stabbed!_  No, no, it missed!  The assailant's down, yes! the\r\nspy's on top, pinning him, a terrific thrashing about, the spy rips off\r\nthe assailant's mask: _a woman!_\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Fumbling behind her, she finds it, wraps her hand around it, tugs. \r\n`Oh!' she gasps, pulling her hand back quickly, her ears turning\r\ncrimson.  `I... I thought it was the soap!' he squeezes her close\r\nbetween his thighs, pulls her back toward him, one hand sliding\r\ndown her tummy between her legs.  I Dream of Jeannie --  `I have to\r\ngo to the bathroom!' says someone outside the door.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She's combing her hair in the bathroom when the phone rings.  She\r\nhurries to answer it before it wakes the baby.  `Hello, Tuckers.' \r\nThere's no answer.  `Hello?'  A soft click.  Strange.  She feels suddenly\r\nalone in the big house, and goes in to watch TV with the children.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Stop it!' she screams.  `Please, stop!'  She's on her hands and knees,\r\ntrying to get up, but they're too strong for her.  Mark holds her head\r\ndown.  `Now, baby, we're gonna teach you how to be a nice girl,' he\r\nsays coldly, and nods at Jack.  When she's doubled over like that, her\r\nskirt rides up her thighs to the leg bands of her panties.  `C'mon,\r\nman, go!  This baby's cold!  She needs your touch!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Parks the car a couple blocks away.  Slips up to the house, glances in\r\nhis window.  Just like he's expected.  Her blouse is off and the kid's\r\nshirt is unbuttoned.  He watches, while slowly, clumsily, childishly,\r\nthey fumble with each other's clothes.  My God, it takes them forever. \r\n`Some party!'  `You said it!'  When they're more or less naked, he\r\nwalks in.  `Hey!  What's going on here?'  They go white as bleu cheese. \r\nHaw haw!  `What's the little thing you got sticking out there, boy?' \r\n`Harry behave yourself!'  No, he doesn't let the kid get dressed, he\r\nsends him home bareassed.  `Bareassed!'  He drinks to that.  `Prom-\r\nises, promises,' says his host's wife.  `I'll mail you your clothes, son!' \r\nHe gazes down on the naked little girl on his couch.  `Looks like you\r\nand me, we got a little secret to keep, honey,' he says coolly.  `Less\r\nyou wanna go home the same way your boyfriend did!'  He chuckles\r\nat his easy wit, leans down over her, and unbuckles his belt.  `Might\r\nas well make it two secrets, right?'  `What in God's name are you\r\ntalking about, Harry?'  He staggers out of there, drink in hand, and\r\ngoes to look for his car.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Hey!  What's going on here?'  They huddle half-naked under the\r\nblanket, caught utterly unawares.  On television: the clickety-click of\r\nfrightened running feet on foreign pavements.  Jack is fumbling for\r\nhis shorts, tangled somehow around his ankles.  The blanket is\r\nsnatched away.  `On your feet there!'  Mr Tucker, Mrs Tucker, Mark's\r\nmom and dad, the police, the neighbours, everybody comes crowding\r\nin.  Hopelessly, he has a terrific erection.  So hard it hurts.  Every-\r\nbody stares down at it.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Bitsy's sleeping on the floor.  The babysitter is taking a bath.  For\r\nmore than an hour now, he's had to use the bathroom.  He doesn't\r\nknow how much longer he can wait.  Finally, he goes to knock on the\r\nbathroom door.  `I have to use the bathroom.'  `Well, come ahead, if\r\nyou have to.'  `Not while you're in there.'  She sighs loudly.  `Okay,\r\nokay, just a minute,' she says, `but you're a real nuisance, Jimmy!' \r\nHe's holding on, pinching it as tight as he can.  _`Hurry!'_  He holds his\r\nbreath, squeezing shut his eyes.  No.  Too late.  At last, she opens the\r\ndoor.  `Jimmy!'  `I _told_ you to hurry!' he sobs.  She drags him into the\r\nbathroom and pulls his pants down.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  He arrives just in time to see her emerge from the bathroom, wrapped\r\nin a towel, to answer the phone.  His two kids sneak up behind her\r\nand pull the towel away.  She's trying to hang onto the phone and get\r\nthe towel back at the same time.  It's quite a picture.  She's got a\r\nsweet ass.  Standing there in the bushes, pawing himself with one\r\nhand, he lifts his glass with the other and toasts her sweet ass, which\r\nhis son now swats.  Haw, haw, maybe that boy's gonna shape up,\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  They're in the bushes, arguing about their next move, when she\r\ncomes out of the bathroom, wrapped in a towel.  They can hear the\r\nbaby crying.  Then it stops.  They see her running, naked, back to the\r\nbathroom like she's scared or something.  `I'm going in after her,\r\nman, whether you're with me or not!' Mark whispers and he starts\r\nout of the bushes.  But just then, a light comes sweeping up through\r\nthe yard, as a car swings in the drive.  They hit the dirt, hearts pound-\r\ning.  `Is it the cops?'  `I don't know!  Do you think they saw us?' \r\n`Sshh!'  A man comes staggering up the walk from the drive, a drink\r\nin his hand, stumbles on in the kitchen door and then straight into\r\nthe bathroom.  `It's Mr Tucker!' Mark whispers.  A scream.  `Let's get\r\nouta here, man!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  9.00.  Having missed most of the spy show anyway and having little\r\nelse to do, the babysitter has washed the dishes and cleaned the\r\nkitchen up a little.  The books on the refrigerator remind her of her\r\nbetter intentions, but she decides that first she'll see what's next on\r\nTV.  In the livingroom, she finds little Bitsy sound asleep on the floor. \r\nShe lifts her gently, carries her into her bed, and tucks her in.  `Okay,\r\nJimmy, it's nine o'clock, I've let you stay up, now be a good boy.' \r\nSullenly, his sleepy eyes glued still to the set, the boy backs out of the\r\nroom towards his bedroom.  A drama comes on.  She switches chan-\r\nnels.  A ballgame and a murder mystery.  She switches back to the\r\ndrama.  It's a love story of some kind.  A man married to an ageing\r\ninvalid wife, but in love with a younger girl.  `Use the bathroom and\r\nbrush your teeth before going to bed, Jimmy!' she calls, but as\r\nquickly regrets it, for she hears the baby stir in its crib.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Two of them are talking about mothers they've salted away in rest\r\nhomes.  Oh boy, that's wonderful, this is one helluva party.  She\r\nleaves them to use the john, takes advantage of the retreat to ease\r\nher girdle down awhile, get a few good deep breaths.  She has this\r\npicture of her three kids carting her off to a rest home.  In a wheel-\r\nbarrow.  That sure is something to look forward to, all right.  When\r\nshe pulls her girdle back up, she can't seem to squeeze into it.  The\r\nhost looks in.  `Hey, Dolly, are you all right?'  `Yeah, I just can't get\r\ninto my damn girdle, that's all.'  `Here, let me help.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She pulls them on, over her own, standing in front of the bedroom\r\nmirror, holding her skirt bundled up around the waist.  About twenty\r\nsizes too big for her, of course.  She pulls them tight from behind,\r\nruns her hand inside the opening in front, pulls out her thumb.  `And\r\nwhat a good boy am I!'  She giggles: how funny it must feel!  Then,\r\nin the mirror, she sees him: in the doorway behind her, sullenly\r\nwatching.  `Jimmy!  You're supposed to be in bed!' `Those are my\r\ndaddy's!' the boy says.  `I'm gonna tell!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Jimmy!' she drags him into the bathroom and pulls his pants down. \r\n`Even your shoes are wet!  Get them off!'  She soaps up a warm wash.\r\ncloth she's had with her in the bathtub, scrubs him from the waist\r\ndown with it.  Bitsy stands in the doorway, staring.  `Get out!  Get\r\nout!' the boy screams at his sister.  `Go back to bed, Bitsy.  It's just\r\nan accident.'  `Get out!'  The baby wakes and starts to howl.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  The young lover feels sorry for her rival, the invalid wife; she be-\r\nlieves the man has a duty towards the poor woman and insists she is\r\nwilling to wait.  But the man argues that he also has a duty towards\r\nhimself: his life, too, is short, and he could not love his wife now\r\neven were she well.  He embraces the young girl feverishly; she twists\r\naway in anguish.  The door opens.  They stand there grinning, look-\r\ning devilish, but pretty silly at the same time.  `Jack!  I thought I told\r\nyou not to come!'  She's angry, but she's also glad in a way: she was\r\nbeginning to feel a little too alone in the big house with the children\r\nall sleeping.  She should have taken that bath, after all.  `We just came\r\nby to see if you were being a good girl,' Jack says and blushes.  The\r\nboys glance at each other nervously.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She's just sunk down into the tubful of warm fragrant suds, ready\r\nfor a nice long soaking, when the phone rings.  Wrapping a towel\r\naround her, she goes to answer: no one there.  But now the baby's\r\nawake and bawling.  She wonders if that's Jack bothering her all the\r\ntime.  If it is, brother, that's the end.  Maybe it's the end anyway.  She\r\ntries to calm the baby with the half-empty bottle, not wanting to\r\nchange it until she's finished her bath.  The bathroom's where the\r\ndiapers go dirty, and they make it stink to high heaven.  `Shush,\r\nshush!' she whispers, rocking the crib.  The towel slips away, leaving\r\nan airy empty tingle up and down her backside.  Even before she\r\nstoops for the towel, even before she turns around, she knows there's\r\nsomebody behind her.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `We just came by to see if you were being a good girl,' Jack says,\r\ngrinning down at her.  She's flushed and silent, her mouth half open. \r\n`Lean over,' says Mark amiably.  `We'll soap your back, as long as\r\nwe're here.'  But she just huddles there, down in the suds, staring up\r\nat them with big eyes.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Hey!  What's going on here?'  It's Mr Tucker, stumbling through the\r\ndoor with a drink in his hand.  She looks up from the TV.  `What's the\r\nmatter, Mr Tucker?'  `Oh, uh, I'm sorry.  I got lost -- no, I mean, I had\r\nto get some aspirin.  Excuse me!'  And he rushes past her into the\r\nbathroom, caroming off the livingroom door jamb on the way.  The\r\nbaby wakes.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Okay, get off her.  Mr Tucker!'  `Jack!' she cries, `what are _you_\r\ndoing here?'  He stares hard at them a moment: so that's where it\r\ngoes.  Then, as Mr Tucker swings heavily off, he leans into the bastard\r\nwith a hard right to the belly.  Next thing he knows, though, he's got\r\na face full of an old man's fist.  He's not sure, as the lights go out, if\r\nthat's his girlfriend screaming or the baby...\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Her host pushes down on her fat fanny and tugs with all his might\r\non her girdle, while she bawls on his shoulder: `I don't _wanna_ go to\r\na rest home!'  `Now, now, take it easy, Dolly, nobody's gonna make\r\nyou --'  `Ouch!  Hey, you're hurting!'  `You should buy a bigger girdle,\r\nDolly.'  `You're telling me!'  Some other guy pokes his head in. \r\n`Whatsamatter?  Dolly fall in?'  `No, she fell out.  Give me a hand.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  By the time she's chased Jack and Mark out of there, she's lost track\r\nof the programme she's been watching on television.  There's another\r\nwoman in the story now for some reason.  That guy lives a very com-\r\nplicated life.  Impatiently, she switches channels.  She hates ball-\r\ngames, so she settles for the murder mystery.  She switches just in\r\ntime, too: there's a dead man sprawled out on the floor of what\r\nlooks like an office or a study or something.  A heavyset detective\r\ngazes up from his couch over the body: `He's been strangled.' \r\nMaybe she'll take that bath, after all.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She drags him into the bathroom and pulls his pants down.  She\r\nsoaps up a warm washcloth she's had in the tub with her, but just as\r\nshe reaches between his legs, it starts to spurt, spraying her arms and\r\nhands.  `Oh, Jimmy!  I thought you were done!' she cries, pulling him\r\ntowards the toilet and aiming it into the bowl.  How moist and rub.\r\nbery it is!  And you can turn it every which way.  How funny it must\r\nfeel!\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Stop it!' she screams.  `Please stop!'  She's on her hands and knees\r\nand Jack is holding her head down.  `Now we're gonna teach you\r\nhow to be a nice girl,' Mark says and lifts her skirt.  `Well, I'll be\r\ndamned!'  `What's the matter?' asks Jack, his heart pounding.  `Look\r\nat this big pair of men's underpants she's got on!'  `Those are my\r\ndaddy's!' says Jimmy, watching them from the doorway.  `I'm gonna\r\ntell!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  People are shooting at each other in the murder mystery, but she's so\r\nmixed up, she doesn't know which ones are the good guys.  She\r\nswitches back to the love story.  Something seems to have happened.\r\nbecause now the man is kissing his invalid wife tenderly.  Maybe\r\nshe's finally dying.  The baby wakes, begins to scream.  Let it.  She\r\nturns up the volume on the TV.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Leaning down over her, unbuckling his belt.  It's all happening just\r\nlike he's known it would.  Beautiful!  The kid is gone, though his\r\npants, poor lad, remain.  `Looks like you and me, we got a secret to\r\nkeep, child!'  But he's cramped on the couch and everything is too\r\nslippery and small.  `Lift your legs up, honey.  Put them around my\r\nback.'  But instead she screams.  He rolls off, crashing to the floor. \r\nThere they all come, through the front door.  On television, some.\r\nbody is saying: `Am I a burden to you, darling?'  `Dolly!  My God! \r\nDolly, I can explain...!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  The game of the night is Get Dolly Tucker Back in Her Girdle\r\nAgain.  They've got her down on her belly in the livingroom and the\r\nwhole damn crowd is working on her.  Several of them are stretching\r\nthe girdle, while others try to jam the fat inside.  `I think we made a\r\ncouple inches on this side!  Roll her over!'  Harry?\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She's just stepped into the tub, when the phone rings, waking the\r\nbaby.  She sinks down in the suds, trying not to hear.  But that baby\r\ndoesn't cry, it screams.  Angrily, she wraps a towel around herself,\r\nstamps peevishly into the baby's room, just letting the phone jangle. \r\nShe tosses the baby down on its back, unpins its nappies hastily, and\r\ngets yellowish baby stool all over her hands.  Her towel drops away. \r\nShe turns to find Jimmy staring at her like a little idiot.  She slaps\r\nhim in the face with her dirty hand, while the baby screams, the\r\nphone rings, and nagging voices argue on the TV.  There are better\r\nthings she might be doing.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  What's happening?  Now there's a young guy in it.  Is he after the\r\nyoung girl or the old invalid?  To tell the truth, it looks like he's after\r\nthe same man the women are.  In disgust, she switches channels. \r\n`The strangler again,' growls the fat detective, hands on hips, staring\r\ndown at the body of a half-naked girl.  She's considering either\r\nswitching back to the love story or taking a quick bath, when a hand\r\nsuddenly clutches her mouth.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `You're both chicken,' she says, staring up at them.  `But what if Mr\r\nTucker comes home?' Mark asks nervously.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  How did he get here?  He's standing pissing in his own goddamn\r\nbathroom, his wife is still back at the party, the three of them are,\r\nlike good kids, sitting in there in the living-room watching TV.  One\r\nof them is his host's boy Mark.  `It's a good murder mystery, Mr\r\nTucker,' Mark said, when he came staggering in on them a minute\r\nago.  `Sit still!' he shouted, `I'm just home for a moment!'  Then\r\nwhump thump on into the bathroom.  Long hike for a weewee,\r\nMister.  But something keeps bothering him.  Then it hits him: the\r\ngirl's panties, hanging like a broken balloon from the rabbit-ear\r\nantennae on the TV!  He barges back in there, giving his shoulder a\r\nhelluva crack on the livingroom door jamb on the way -- but they're\r\nnot hanging there any more.  Maybe he's only imagined it.  `Hey, Mr\r\nTucker,' Mark says flatly.  `Your fly's open.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  The baby's dirty, stinks to high heaven.  She hurries back to the living-\r\nroom, hearing sirens and gunshots.  The detective is crouched outside\r\na house, peering in.  Already, she's completely lost.  The baby screams\r\nat the top of its lungs.  She turns up the volume.  But it's all confused. \r\nShe hurries back in there, claps an angry hand to the baby's mouth. \r\n`Shut up!' she cries.  She throws the baby down on its back, starts to\r\nunpin the nappy, as the baby tunes up again.  The phone rings.  She\r\nanswers it, one eye on the TV.  _`What?'_  The baby cries so hard it\r\nstarts to choke.  Let it.  `I said, hi, this is Jack!'  Then it hits her: oh\r\nno! the nappy pin!\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `The aspirin...'  But she's already in the tub.  Way down in the tub. \r\nStaring at him through the water.  Her tummy looks pale and ripply. \r\nHe hears sirens, people on the porch.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Jimmy gets up to go to the bathroom and gets his face slapped and\r\nsmeared with baby poop.  Then she hauls him off to the bathroom,\r\nyanks off his pyjamas, and throws him into the tub.  That's okay, but\r\nnext she gets naked and acts like she's gonna get in the tub, too.  The\r\nbaby's screaming and the phone's ringing like crazy and in walks his\r\ndad.  Saved! he thinks, but, no, his dad grabs him right back out of\r\nthe tub and whales the dickens out of him, no questions asked, while\r\nshe watches, then sends him -- _whack!_ -- back to bed.  So he's lying\r\nthere, wet and dirty and naked and sore, and he still has to go to\r\nthe bathroom, and outside his window he hears two older guys talk-\r\ning.  `Listen, you know where to do it if we get her pinned?'  `No! \r\nDon't you?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Yo ho heave ho!  _Ugh!'_  Dolly's on her back and they're working on\r\nthe belly side.  Somebody got the great idea of buttering her down\r\nfirst.  Not to lose the ground they've gained, they've shot it inside\r\nwith a basting syringe.  But now suddenly there's this big tug-of-war\r\nunder way between those who want to stuff her in and those who\r\nwant to let her out.  Something rips, but she feels better.  The odour of\r\nhot butter makes her think of movie theatres and popcorn.  `Hey, has\r\nanybody seen Harry?' she asks.  `Where's Harry?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Somebody's getting chased.  She switches back to the love story, and\r\nnow the man's back kissing the young lover again.  What's going on? \r\nShe gives it up, decides to take a quick bath.  She's just stepping into\r\nthe tub, one foot in, one foot out, when Mr Tucker walks in.  `Oh,\r\nexcuse me!  I only wanted some aspirin...!'  He embraces her\r\nsavagely, his calloused old hands clutching roughly at her backside. \r\n`Mr Tucker!' she cries, squirming.  `Your wife called --!'  He's pushing\r\nsomething between her legs, hurting her.  She slips, they both slip --\r\nsomething cold and hard slams her in the back, cracks her skull, she\r\nseems to be sinking into a sea...\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  They've got her over the hassock, skirt up and pants down.  `Give her\r\na lesson there, Jack baby!'  The television lights flicker and flash over\r\nher glossy flesh.  =1000 when lit.=  Whack!  Slap!  Bumper to bumper! \r\nHe leans into her, feeling her come alive.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  The phone rings, waking the baby.  `Jack, is that you?  Now, you\r\nlisten to me --!'  `No, dear, this is Mrs Tucker.  Isn't the TV awfully\r\nloud?'  `Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Tucker!  I've been getting --'  `I tried to\r\ncall you before, but I couldn't hang on.  To the phone, I mean.  I'm\r\nsorry, dear.'  `Just a minute, Mrs Tucker, the baby's --'  `Honey, listen! \r\nIs Harry there?  Is Mr Tucker there, dear?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Stop it!' she screams and claps a hand over the baby's mouth.  `Stop\r\nit!  Stop it!  _Stop it!'_  Her other hand is full of baby stool and she's\r\nafraid she's going to be sick.  The phone rings.  `No!' she cries.  She's\r\nhanging on to the baby, leaning woozily away, listening to the phone\r\nring.  `Okay, okay,' she sighs, getting ahold of herself.  But when she\r\nlets go of the baby, it isn't screaming any more.  She shakes it.  Oh\r\nno...\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Hello?'  No answer.  Strange.  She hangs up and, wrapped only in a\r\ntowel, stares out the window at the cold face staring in -- she\r\nscreams!\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She screams, scaring the hell out of him.  He leaps out of the tub,\r\nglances up at the window she's gaping at just in time to see two faces\r\nduck away, then slips on the bathroom tiles, and crashes to his ass,\r\nwhacking his head on the sink on the way down.  She stares down at\r\nhim, trembling, a towel over her narrow shoulders.  `Mr Tucker!  Mr\r\nTucker, are you all right...?'  Who's Sorry Now?  Yessir, who's back\r\nis breaking with each...  He stares up at the little tufted locus of all\r\nhis woes, and passes out, dreaming of Jeannie...\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  The phone rings.  `Dolly!  It's for you!'  `Hello?'  `Hello, Mrs Tucker?' \r\n`Yes, speaking.'  `Mrs Tucker, this is the police calling...'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  It's cramped and awkward and slippery, but he's pretty sure he got it\r\nin her, once anyway.  When he gets the suds out of his eyes, he sees\r\nher staring up at them.  Through the water.  `Hey, Mark!  Let her up!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Down in the suds.  Feeling sleepy.  The phone rings, startling her. \r\nWrapped in a towel, she goes to answer.  `No, he's not here, Mrs\r\nTucker.'  Strange.  Married people act pretty funny sometimes.  The\r\nbaby is awake and screaming.  Dirty, a real mess.  Oh boy, there's a\r\nlot of things she'd rather be doing than babysitting in this mad-\r\nhouse.  She decides to wash the baby off in her own bathwater.  She\r\nremoves her towel, unplugs the tub, lowers the water level so the\r\nbaby can sit.  Glancing back over her shoulder, she sees Jimmy staring\r\nat her.  `Go back to bed, Jimmy.'  `I have to go to the bathroom.'  `Good\r\ngrief, Jimmy!  It looks like you already have!'  The phone rings.  She\r\ndoesn't bother with the towel -- what can Jimmy see he hasn't already\r\nseen? -- and goes to answer.  `No, Jack, and that's final.'  Sirens, on the\r\nTV, as the police move in.  But wasn't that the channel with the love\r\nstory?  Ambulance maybe.  Get this over with so she can at least catch\r\nthe news.  `Get those wet pyjamas off, Jimmy, and I'll find clean ones. \r\nMaybe you better get in the tub, too.'  `I think something's wrong\r\nwith the baby,' he says.  `It's down in the water and it's not swimming\r\nor anything.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She's staring up at them from the rug.  They slap her.  Nothing hap-\r\npens.  `You just tilted her, man!' Mark says softly.  `We gotta get outa\r\nhere!'  Two little kids are standing wide-eyed in the doorway.  Mark\r\nlooks hard at Jack.  `No, Mark, they're just little kids...!'  `We gotta,\r\nman, or we're dead.'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Dolly!  My God!  Dolly, I can explain!'  She glowers down at them,\r\nher ripped girdle around her ankles.  `What the four of you are doing\r\nin the bathtub with _my_ babysitter?' she says sourly.  `I can hardly\r\nwait!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  Police sirens wail, lights flash.  `I heard the scream!' somebody\r\nshouts.  `There were two boys!'  `I saw a man!'  `She was running with\r\nthe baby!'  `My God!' somebody screams, `they're _all_ dead!'  Crowds\r\ncome running.  Spotlights probe the bushes.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Harry, where the hell you been?' his wife whines, glaring blearily\r\nup at him from the carpet.  `I can explain,' he says.  `Hey, whatsa- \r\nmatter, Harry?' his host asks, smeared with butter for some god-\r\ndamn reason.  `You look like you just seen a ghost!'  Where did be\r\nleave his drink?  Everybody's laughing, everybody except Dolly, whole\r\ncheeks are streaked with tears.  `Hey, Harry, you won't let them take\r\nme to a _rest_ home, will you, Harry?'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  10.00.  The dishes done, children to bed, her books read, she watches\r\nthe news on television.  Sleepy.  The man's voice is gentle, soothing. \r\nShe dozes -- awakes with a start: a babysitter?  Did the announcer\r\nsay something about a babysitter?\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `Just want to catch the weather,' the host says, switching on the\r\nTV.  Most of the guests are leaving, but the Tuckers stay to watch\r\nthe news.  As it comes on, the announcer is saying something about a\r\nbabysitter.  The host switches channels.  `They got a better weather-\r\nman on four,' he explains.  `Wait!' says Mrs Tucker.  `There was some-\r\nthing about a babysitter...!'  The host switches back.  `Details have\r\nnot yet been released by the police,' the announcer says.  `Harry,\r\nmaybe we'd better go...'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  They stroll casually out of the drugstore, run into a buddy of theirs. \r\n`Hey!  Did you hear about the babysitter?' the guy asks.  Mark grunts.\r\nglances at Jack.  `Got a smoke?' he asks the guy.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `I think I hear the baby screaming!' Mrs Tucker cries, running\r\nacross the lawn from the drive.\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  She wakes, startled, to find Mr Tucker hovering over her.  `I must\r\nhave dozed off!' she exclaims.  `Did you hear the news about the\r\nbabysitter?' Mrs Tucker asks.  `Part of it,' she says, rising.  `Too bad.\r\nwasn't it?'  Mr Tucker is watching the report of the ball scores and\r\ngolf tournaments.  `I'll drive you home in just a minute, dear,' he says. \r\n`Why, how nice!' Mrs Tucker exclaims from the kitchen.  `The dishes\r\nare all done!'\r\n\r\n        \"*\"\r\n\r\n  `What can I say, Dolly?' the host says with a sigh, twisting the but-\r\ntered strands of her ripped girdle between his fingers.  `Your children\r\nare murdered, your husband gone, a corpse in your bathtub, and your\r\nhouse is wrecked.  I'm sorry.  But what can I say?'  On the TV, the news\r\nis over, and they're selling aspirin.  `Hell, I don't know,' she says. \r\n`Let's see what's on the late late movie.'", author_id: 3, user_id: 4, year: 1969},
  {title: "My Last Duchess", text: "That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,\r\nLooking as if she were alive. I call\r\nThat piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands\r\nWorked busily a day, and there she stands.\r\nWill’t please you sit and look at her? I said\r\n“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read\r\nStrangers like you that pictured countenance,\r\nThe depth and passion of its earnest glance,\r\nBut to myself they turned (since none puts by\r\nThe curtain I have drawn for you, but I)\r\nAnd seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,\r\nHow such a glance came there; so, not the first\r\nAre you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not\r\nHer husband’s presence only, called that spot\r\nOf joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps\r\nFra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps\r\nOver my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint\r\nMust never hope to reproduce the faint\r\nHalf-flush that dies along her throat.” Such stuff\r\nWas courtesy, she thought, and cause enough\r\nFor calling up that spot of joy. She had\r\nA heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,\r\nToo easily impressed; she liked whate’er\r\nShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere.\r\nSir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,\r\nThe dropping of the daylight in the West,\r\nThe bough of cherries some officious fool\r\nBroke in the orchard for her, the white mule\r\nShe rode with round the terrace—all and each\r\nWould draw from her alike the approving speech,\r\nOr blush, at least. She thanked men—good! but thanked\r\nSomehow—I know not how—as if she ranked\r\nMy gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name\r\nWith anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame\r\nThis sort of trifling? Even had you skill\r\nIn speech—which I have not—to make your will\r\nQuite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this\r\nOr that in you disgusts me; here you miss,\r\nOr there exceed the mark”—and if she let\r\nHerself be lessoned so, nor plainly set\r\nHer wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse—\r\nE’en then would be some stooping; and I choose\r\nNever to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,\r\nWhene’er I passed her; but who passed without\r\nMuch the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;\r\nThen all smiles stopped together. There she stands\r\nAs if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet\r\nThe company below, then. I repeat,\r\nThe Count your master’s known munificence\r\nIs ample warrant that no just pretense\r\nOf mine for dowry will be disallowed;\r\nThough his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed\r\nAt starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go\r\nTogether down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,\r\nTaming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,\r\nWhich Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!", author_id: 4, user_id: 3, year: 1842},

When no voice replied,\r\nShe put my arm about her waist,\r\n       And made her smooth white shoulder bare,\r\nAnd all her yellow hair displaced,\r\n       And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,\r\n       And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,\r\nMurmuring how she loved me — she\r\n       Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,\r\nTo set its struggling passion free\r\n       From pride, and vainer ties dissever,\r\n       And give herself to me for ever.\r\nBut passion sometimes would prevail,\r\n       Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain\r\nA sudden thought of one so pale\r\n       For love of her, and all in vain:\r\n       So, she was come through wind and rain.\r\nBe sure I looked up at her eyes\r\n       Happy and proud; at last I knew\r\nPorphyria worshipped me; surprise\r\n       Made my heart swell, and still it grew\r\n       While I debated what to do.\r\nThat moment she was mine, mine, fair,\r\n       Perfectly pure and good: I found\r\nA thing to do, and all her hair\r\n       In one long yellow string I wound\r\n       Three times her little throat around,\r\nAnd strangled her. No pain felt she;\r\n       I am quite sure she felt no pain.\r\nAs a shut bud that holds a bee,\r\n       I warily oped her lids: again\r\n       Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.\r\nAnd I untightened next the tress\r\n       About her neck; her cheek once more\r\nBlushed bright beneath my burning kiss:\r\n       I propped her head up as before,\r\n       Only, this time my shoulder bore\r\nHer head, which droops upon it still:\r\n       The smiling rosy little head,\r\nSo glad it has its utmost will,\r\n       That all it scorned at once is fled,\r\n       And I, its love, am gained instead!\r\nPorphyria's love: she guessed not how\r\n       Her darling one wish would be heard.\r\nAnd thus we sit together now,\r\n       And all night long we have not stirred,\r\n       And yet God has not said a word!", author_id: 4, user_id: 3, year: 1836}
